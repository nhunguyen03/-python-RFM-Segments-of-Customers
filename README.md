## OVERVIEW
An online retailer needs to offer a diverse range of products. To optimize marketing and sales strategies, the company uses RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment its customer base. This segmentation helps tailor strategies for different customer groups. For instance, loyal customers (Champions) can receive exclusive offers, potential loyalists can be targeted with promotions, and at-risk customers can be re-engaged with reminders and special offers. New customers can be welcomed with discounts, and inactive customers can be reactivated with significant promotions. RFM segmentation provides valuable insights, allowing company to enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue.
